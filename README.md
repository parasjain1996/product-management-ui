Product Management System Documentation
Architecture Design
Backend Architecture
Microservices Approach
•	Microservices Architecture: Implement a microservices architecture to achieve scalability, modularity, and independent deployment of product management functionalities.
Components
•	Product Service: Manages CRUD operations for products.
Communication
•	RESTful APIs: Utilize RESTful APIs for communication between services to ensure loose coupling and flexibility.
Frontend Architecture
Single Page Application (SPA)
•	React.js: Develop the frontend using React.js to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Component-Based Architecture
•	Reusable Components: Design and implement reusable components for product listing, product detail views, etc.
State Management
•	State Management Libraries: Use state management libraries such as Redux for managing the application state.
Database Schema Design
Product Entity
Attributes
•	id: Unique identifier for the product.
•	name: Name of the product.
•	description: Description of the product.
•	price: Price of the product.
•	category: Category to which the product belongs.
•	stockQuantity: Quantity of the product in stock.
•	createdAt: Timestamp indicating when the product was created.
•	updatedAt: Timestamp indicating the last update time of the product.
Relationships
•	NoSQL Database (MongoDB):
o	Collections: Use a single collection for storing products.
o	Indexes: Create indexes on id for quick lookup and createdAt for sorting.
o	Schema Flexibility: Leverage MongoDB's flexibility to accommodate changes in product attributes or schema evolution.
Technical Flow Diagram
Frontend (React)
1.	User Interface (UI) Components
o	ProductList
o	ProductDetails
o	AddProduct
o	EditProduct
o	DeleteProduct
2.	React Router
o	Handles routing between different pages (ProductList, ProductDetails, AddProduct, EditProduct).
3.	State Management
o	Use useState and useEffect hooks.
o	Local component state for managing products, search terms, sorting, and pagination.
4.	Services
o	productService: Manages API calls to the backend.
5.	Material-UI
o	Utilizes UI components like Table, Button, TextField, etc.
Backend (Spring Boot)
1.	Controller Layer
o	ProductController: Manages incoming HTTP requests and maps them to the appropriate service methods.
2.	Service Layer
o	ProductService: Contains business logic.
o	ProductServiceImpl: Implementation of ProductService.
3.	Repository Layer
o	ProductRepository: Interface for CRUD operations with the MongoDB database.
4.	Model Layer
o	Product: Entity representing a product.
5.	Database
o	MongoDB: NoSQL database to store product data.
Diagram Components
Frontend
•	User Interaction -> UI Components -> React Router -> State Management -> Services -> API Calls to Backend
Backend
•	API Requests -> Controller Layer -> Service Layer -> Repository Layer -> Database
Testing
•	Unit Tests: Ensure comprehensive unit tests are written to cover all functionalities and branches, including null and non-null scenarios.
•	Integration Tests: Implement integration tests to verify the correct interaction between different layers and components.
•	Test Coverage

Integrations
•	Product Analytics: Integrate with open-source APIs or SDKs to add functionalities such as product analytics for better insights and reporting.
